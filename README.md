Topological Sort App - Hybrid Route


Ok guys, first, if you haven't done so, read this: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.  This is how GitHub works and this will prevent us from deleting or writing over things that we shouldn't (i.e. editing the branches and not the master).

Second, here is an outline of the project.  Let's continue to edit this and add to it so everybody knows what's going on.  Revise your timeline and tasks as you see fit.  This is just a rough draft that Michael and I sketched out.


  I.  Task: Write/convert topological sort code
  
    a.  People involved:
      i. Michael and Sarah?
    b. Language/software used:
      i. Provisionally JavaScript
    c. Methods included:
      i. Topo-sort logic
      ii. Data cleaning/trimming
    d. Timeline:
      i. Goal: Completed code by Friday at 11:59 PM
      
  II. Task: Create GUI
  
    a. People involved:
      i. Clayton and Jordan/Mark?
    b. Language/software used:
      i. HTML and Visual Studio (discussed on Monday)
    c. Methods included:
      i. Data input buttons/ fields
      ii. Run program button
    d. Timeline:
      i. Goal: Completed code by Friday at 11:59 PM
      
  III.Task: Combine

    a. People involved:
      i. Wei and Jordan/Mark?
    b. Jobs: 
      i. KEEP THE OTHER GROUPS WORKING
      ii. Research how app will interface the GUI and the code - how does javascript plug in to html?
      iii. Check/revise other groups as necessary for your combining.
    c. Timeline:
      i. Goal: Completed app by Sunday at 11:59 PM
